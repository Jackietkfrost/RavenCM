## The App
This app was created as a way for new players to the table top RPG DnD 5e to quickly and easily be able to create characters that they can then manage from their computers. This will allow players to level up their characters, change what's in their inventory, and change their character's stats from their computers, which both gets new games up and running very quickly, and hides some of the more confusing and boring aspects of the game for new players.

This app will also work great for those who play DnD 5e over the web, as they can simply have the app up and running as they use whatever other RPG client they like to host the game.
